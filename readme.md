# üçö The Ultimate Biryani Detector 3000‚Ñ¢ üçõ

## What is this sorcery?

Welcome to the *most scientifically advanced* biryani detection system ever created by one person with too much free time and an unhealthy obsession with rice dishes! 

I developed this revolutionary app after years of being served "biryani" that was actually just colored rice with some spices thrown in as an afterthought. THE DECEPTION ENDS TODAY.

## The Science Behind Biryani Detection‚Ñ¢

Using my proprietary BDSM (Biriyani Detection Source Matrix) architecture, I've trained a sophisticated convolutional neural network on approximately 9,283 images of authentic biryani and 7,426 images of rice dishes masquerading as biryani.

The model employs a technique I call "Multi-Layered Spice Recognition" (MLSR), which analyzes the pixel formations that correspond to the typical stratification patterns observed in authentic dum-cooked biryani. It can detect with 98.7% accuracy* whether that dish is ACTUALLY biryani or just some sad pulao trying to get a promotion.


## Features

- **Real-time Biryani Detection**: Point your camera at any suspicious rice dish
- **Gallery Import**: Already took a photo of that questionable "biryani"? Import it!
- **Scientific Results**: Get precise measurements of biryani authenticity
- **Zero Cloud Dependency**: All processing happens on-device, because I don't have money for servers

## Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/kichu12348/BiryAI.git

# Install dependencies
cd biri-detector
npm install

# Run the app
npx expo start
```

## How It Actually Works

Behind all the jokes, this app uses a TensorFlow.js model trained to classify images as either "biryani" or "not biryani." The model runs entirely on your device using TensorFlow.js's React Native implementation.

The app leverages:
- React Native with Expo for the UI
- TensorFlow.js for on-device inference
- A 224x224x3 input CNN for image classification
- My tears when I realized how many pictures of biryani I had to look at during development

## Future Plans

I'm planning to expand the app to detect specific regional biryani varieties:
- Hyderabadi
- Lucknowi
- Kolkata
- That weird one my neighbor makes with pineapple (WHY?!)

## Disclaimer

This app was created for entertainment purposes and should not be used to settle heated biryani debates at family gatherings. I will not be responsible for any rice-related disputes that may arise from its use.

## License

This project is licensed under the "Feed Me Biryani" License - if you use this code, you legally owe me one plate of authentic biryani.
